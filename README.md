A novel method to combine high-resolution data with large-scale missing information with low-resolution data containing the short spacing.

## Description

### Input:

fits files of Herschel at wavelengths of 70 mm, 160 mm, 250 mm, 350 mm, and 500 mm

### Output:

fits files converted units for 70mm and 160mm 

fits files with unified resolutions for each band

fits files cropped for each band

fits files of hydrogen molecular column density and temperature by pixel-by-pixel fitting results

### Usage:

Inside python
